                    <h1>Welcome to London!</h1>
                    <p>Syracuse University's London Center offers something for every student, whether they are interested in pursuing a career in drama, art and design, communications, 
                        or dozens of other areas of study. Located in Bloomsbury, London's academic district, the London Center offers special programs in Architecture, Design, Drama and Computer Science.
                        Between classes, students are encouraged to explore the sprawling, historic city and lose themselves in the broad range of opportunities at their fingertips. Students can also 
                        gain further professional experience by taking part in the Syracuse London Internship Program, which offers students the chance to work for a local, national or international organization
                        located in the city.

                        and Notting Hill. Each neighborhood offers a different experience but promises an equally enriching cultural experience.

                    <p> While living in London, students will reside in flats, rather than in college dorms. These flats are located in a range of different buildings across London, and as such, each 
                        is unique from the others. Though flat-living is different from living in a dorm, each building comes with a guide to answer any questions about the electrical devices, showers, 
                        and kitchen appliances that the flats are stocked with.

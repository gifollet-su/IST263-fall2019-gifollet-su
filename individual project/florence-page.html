                <h1>Welcome to Florence!</h1>
                <p>Studying abroad in Florence, Italy offers Syracuse University students the opportunity to surround themselves with a rich artistic and cultural history. Students will 
                    expand their proficiency in the Italian language while taking courses at Syracuse University's Florence Center or at the University of Florence. Outside of their academic pursuits, students
                    are urged to leave campus and become familiar with the rich cultural opportunities both within the city and throughout the country of Italy. Students can also take part in an intership to 
                    gain professional experience in an international setting. Whatever area of study students choose to pursue, Florence offers a deeply engaging and educational academic experience.

                <h2>Housing & Pricing</h2>
                <p>While studying in Florence, the majority of students will live with a host family. Many students find living with an Italian family to be a valuable experience
                        and an opportunity to both improve their Italian proficiency and gain first-hand experience with authentic Italian traditions, cuisine and celebrations. These families are thoroughly
                        screened by Syracuse University to ensure that they pose no threat to students, and can range from large families to elderly couples to couples with young children. Architecture and studio arts students
                        studying in Florence can choose to share an apartment with other students if they prefer not to live with a host family.

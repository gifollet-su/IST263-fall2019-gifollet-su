<h1>Gillian Follett Individual Project Idea</h1>
<body>My website will feature information about a few of the study abroad programs at Syracuse University. 
  I will get information about the programs from the <abbr title="Syracuse University">SU</abbr> website and use stock photos for images. 
  <p>I will likely focus on three study abroad programs that I’m personally trying to decide between— Madrid, Florence, and London—
  and give each program its own page.</p>
  <p>To avoid any intellectual property issues, I will reword and restructure the text from the <abbr title="Syracuse University">SU</abbr> website and include it on my own site.
  I will highlight educational information about each site, such as the courses offered, and also describe the attractions located in each city.</p>
